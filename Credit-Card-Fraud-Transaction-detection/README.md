2. EDA was done to analyse and extract insights of data present

3. Data Pre-processing : Removal of duplicate and null values were done

4. ML models : Logistic regression,Linear SVM,RF and xgboost algorithms were applied on the dataset with hyperparameter tuning to calculate perfomance metrics i.e. precision,recall,F1 score & Area under precision-recall curve and at the end summarized all the results.
