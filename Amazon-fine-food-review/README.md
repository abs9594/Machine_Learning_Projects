    The problem statment is taken from a kaggle competion where we were needed to find sentiment i.e. positive or negative of food reviews dataset

Steps followed for approaching the solution:

1. Data Collection : Data was taken and is available at kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews)

2. EDA was done to analyse and extract insights of data present

3. Data Pre-processing : Various pre-processing meausures were implemented like Removing html-tags/Punctuations/Stopwords, performing stemming etc on the text features

4. Feature Engineering_1 : Created a new feature,Removed correlated features. As most important information is present in summary so we increaed weight of summary 3 times in the text feature

5. Feature Engineering_2 : All the text data was vectorized using BOW/tfidf/word2vec/tfidf-weighted-word2vec and scaling was done on numerical features then all the features and were concatinated for feeding it to ML models

6. ML models : Logistic regression,Linear SVM,RF and xgboost algorithms were applied on the dataset with hyperparameter tuning to calculate perfomance metrics i.e. precision,recall,F1 score etc. and at the end summarized all the results.
